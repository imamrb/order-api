## Node Express API Example : Order API

A minimal order api built with node and express.

# Getting started

To get the Node server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- Install MongoDB Community Edition ([instructions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#tutorials)) and run it
- `cp .env.example .env` and update the environment variables
- `npm run dev` to start the local server

## Dependencies

- [expressjs](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - The server for handling and routing HTTP requests
- [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) - For modeling and mapping MongoDB data to javascript
- [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) - HTTP request logger middleware for node.js

## Application Structure

- `app.js` - The entry point to our application. This file defines our express server and connects it to MongoDB using mongoose. It also requires the routes and models we'll be using in the application.
- `routes/` - This folder contains the route definitions for our API.
- `models/` - This folder contains the schema definitions for our Mongoose models.
